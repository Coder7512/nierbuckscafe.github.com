            <h4 align="center"> One of the most consumed beverages in the world is coffee. Aside from water, some people assert that it is the liquid that is consumed the most globally.  But coffee is more than just a drink. It is connected into our lives as a memory, an expectation, and a lifetime of comfort moments of minor pleasure.  Coffee's popularity as a beverage is certainly related to the caffeine it contains as well as to its enjoyable taste. Coffee drinkers have come to relate the richness and scent of the cup with the energizing boost that caffeine provides.
